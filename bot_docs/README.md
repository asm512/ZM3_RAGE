# Bot Docs


##### Bot docs are the files that `Sensei` (Discord Bot) parses in order to yield an embed replying to the query at hand
##### Keywords are by default written on the first line split with a `,` comma, these are the keywords which the bot looks through and if a file contains one then the contents of said file are sent as an embed. By default the embed is converted to lowercase meaning that keywords must all be lowercase too
