# Zmodeler3 Documentation for GTA V


##### This project is aimed to become a community-driven sort of Wiki in all documentation regarding everything to do with converting and exporting models into native RAGE engine formats using Zmodeler3, mainly focused around vehicles since other formats can be exporting using [Gims EVO](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/gims-evo-with-gta-v-support) 
##### Feel free to contribute whether that means contacting me or submitting a PR to this repo, as long as it's formatted correctly (MD style and fits the other docs), it's a go ahead!
